## Chapter 01 - Introduction 🚀

Before we being doing anything, lets talk about what all we will be learning in detail, I did give a gist of what we will be covering in the README of the repository, but to give a better understanding of what we will be doing, I decided to list all the things that we will be learning here. 

In this repo, we will be learning the following things:  
1. The basics of making Commands and Events
2. A few Advanced topics 
3. A few Example plugins to practice 
4. Some cool tricks to make the coding process easier
5. Analyzing, designing, and programming our own plugin

Okay that is all, I think I have covered everything that I have planned, but   
⚠️ `Beware, the above list is subject to change as more people add or delete things!`

🚀 Now lets talk about the `pre-requisites` of making minecraft plugins.

Pre-requisites for making Minecraft plugins are:

 1. **Knowledge of Java programming language**
    - It is suggested that people have an understanding advanced topics such as Collections, Streams, Generics, Threads, etc...
    - If you are unfamiliar with Java, I would suggest you to stop reading and go learn Java first! 🚩

2. **Minecraft**
    - We will ofcourse need Minecraft to make Minecraft plugins
    - It is also suggested that people know their way around Minecraft and have an understanding of how things work on minecraft.

3. **Minecraft Test Server**
    - To test out our plugins, by ourselves or with friends, we need to have a minecraft test server.
    - We will do this too, because its essential.

4. **A Java IDE** (We will be using IntelliJ IDEA)
    - The means of coding our plugin from the ground up.
    - Feel free to use any IDE!

If you, at any point feel you are stuck, feel free to drop a message in my DMs or try hoping into any of the Minecraft developer servers, **you will find the required help,** or if that does not solve things, try researching the problem and submit a PR to this repository as then we can add that error onto our page, just so other developers like you, don't face the same problems 😊👍
