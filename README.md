# **Learning Minecraft Plugin Development**
### Welcome, wizard! 🔮

So, you want to learn how to make minecraft plugins!? 😃 Then you are at the right place, because that is exactly what we will be doing here, 
> ⚠️ But one disclaimer is, this is not a `guide` or a `book of secrets` of any sorts, 

> **⚠️ This repository is used to document my journey on getting foundational knowledge on making minecraft plugins, And also working on basic projects for practicing and refining the newly learnt skill.**

In this repository, we will be covering making a **"Minecraft Plugin"** from scratch. Starting from installing required dependancies and resources all the way to some fun projects that will help boost your skills in the making of minecraft plugins.

We will also be talking about a few common errors, problems, code mistakes, etc... that we might end up making while cooking up the perfect magic recipe (code) 🌌 

Without further ado, lets begin with this journey!
